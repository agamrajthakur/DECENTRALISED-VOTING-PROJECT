Vulnerability,Description,Attack Example,Prevention Method,Severity
Reentrancy Attack,External call allows re-entering function before state update,DAO Hack (2016) - $60M stolen,"ReentrancyGuard, Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern",Critical
Integer Overflow/Underflow,Arithmetic operations exceed data type limits,BatchOverflow Bug (2018),Use Solidity ^0.8.0 or SafeMath library,High
Access Control Issues,Unauthorized users can call privileged functions,Parity Wallet Hack (2017),"Implement Ownable, RBAC modifiers",Critical
Timestamp Dependence,Miners can manipulate block.timestamp,Lottery contract manipulation,Avoid block.timestamp for critical logic,Medium
Front-running Attack,Attacker sees pending transaction and submits higher gas,DEX front-running,"Commit-reveal schemes, batch transactions",High
Denial of Service (DoS),Contract becomes unusable due to resource exhaustion,Gas limit attacks on loops,"Limit loop iterations, use pull over push",Medium
Logic Errors,Flawed business logic in contract,Incorrect calculation formulas,"Thorough testing, formal verification",Variable
Insecure Randomness,Predictable random number generation,Gambling contract exploits,Use Chainlink VRF or commit-reveal,High
Unchecked External Calls,Failed external calls not properly handled,Funds stuck in contracts,"Check return values, use require()",Medium
Sybil Attack,Multiple fake identities created,Vote manipulation,"KYC verification, identity proofs",Critical
